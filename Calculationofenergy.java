step 1 - let the user enter the initial weight of water in kilogram to be 55.5
step 2 - let the user enter the initial temperature to be 3.5 degree Celsius
step 3 - let the user enter the final temperature to be 10.5 degree Celsius
step 4 - let the user enter that the value of energy be represented by Q and as an unknown quantity
step 5 - let the user enter that the formular to get Q be Q = weight of water(55.5) multiplied by final temperature(10.5) minus initial temperature(3.5)then multiplied by 4184
step 6 - let the computer display that the value of energy(Q) to be 1625484
